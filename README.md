# Fetal-Health-Prediction
An end-to-end data science project to predict fetal health. I made machine learning to classify fetal health based on cardiotocogrphy data because the evaluation takes a long time. Machine learning helps doctors evaluate cardiotocogrphy results so that fetal health checks can be carried out frequently.
