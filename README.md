# Welcome to Fetal-Health-Prediction Project!

This is my first end-to-end Data Science project that combines data cleaning, data analysis, and machine learning modeling. This project predicts the health status of the fetus from cardiotocography data so that the health status of the fetus can be known more easily and quickly.

## Aim of this project

The main goal of this project is to develop a machine-learning classification model that can predict the health status of the fetus. The dataset used comes from the Kaggle website, which contains the results of cardiotocography examinations and the health status of the fetus. In addition, the target of this project is to reduce infant mortality due to pregnant women not knowing the condition of the fetus.

## Content

In this project I did data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning. I used three types of machine learning classifications in this project, namely, Logistic regression, Random forest, and K-Nearest neighbors with the main matrix being recall because I wanted to reduce false negatives in predictions. Model optimization such as Multicolinearity handling, scaling, over-sampling, and hyperparameter tuning I did to get the optimal model.

## Result

A model to predict the health status of the fetus can be built with 96% accuracy and 90% recall. This machine learning can be applied to assist doctors in analyzing cardiotocography results to make it faster, but the results of machine learning predictions need to be double checked by doctors.
The condition of the fetus can be known quickly, so that pregnant women and doctors can provide treatment for at-risk fetuses. Thus the infant mortality rate can be reduced.
